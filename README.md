# artificial-or-real

This project is aimed to investigate how well people are able to distinguish between real data and artificially generated ones and what factors play a key role in it. For that 3 questionnaires with artificial and real [images](https://forms.gle/qp3Bmp4oAX218GDo6), [texts](https://forms.gle/GKj8AzzA99ARmk5aA) and [sounds](https://forms.gle/vhEoZV6AEc5wfXGL8) were created and distributed through social media (Facebook, vk.com) and the University of Tartu workers mailing list. The answers were collected during the period 23.12.2019 - 18.01.2020.

The analysis of the collected data started on 15.01.2020 and results can be found in notebooks [images_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ShalyginaA/artificial-or-real/blob/master/images_analysis.ipynb), [sound_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ShalyginaA/artificial-or-real/blob/master/sound_analysis.ipynb) and [texts_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ShalyginaA/artificial-or-real/blob/master/texts_analysis.ipynb).
